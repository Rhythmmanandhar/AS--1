                I have had some prior experience designing pages with HTML and CSS. However, I did it without any deep knowledge of the different components it takes to make these webpages. 
                While I was able to create these webpages, it felt wrong to do so without understanding the internal components, particularly the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element. 
                I had no idea whatsoever about that, but I have gained a clear understanding while completing this project. CSS styling was quite hard, and debugging became an important process 
                because my elements didn't align as expected. I had to carefully design it, which was a stimulating experience.
            </p>

            <p>To provide a consistent and familiar experience, I used the same headers and footers across all pages. In my index.html page, I incorporated a picture to grab the user's attention and included sections showcasing my skills and how to connect with me. 
                For projects.html, I included three placeholder projects. The box shadow feature particularly interested me here. Finally, on the contact.html page, I wanted to share more about myself, so I placed an image with my personal information side-by-side with a contact form.
            </p>

            <p>My module experience was good. I learned a lot about CSS design. Initially, I focused on making the website work functionally. However, I also realized the importance of user-friendliness. 
                So, I had to manage the different color components and sections to create a cohesive and visually appealing design. I aimed for complementary colors whenever possible. Ultimately, the experience was knowledgeable and fun.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some problems I faced during the programming was when I was adding the images in the website. I couldn't figure out the right way to do it so, I haven;t uploaded any images in the website including the validation screenshot but i have made sure to put it in the word document.
